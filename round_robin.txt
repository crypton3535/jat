Roundrobin
(RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and network schedulers in
computing. As the term is generally used, time slices are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all
processes without priority (also known as cyclic executive). Roundrobin
scheduling is simple, easy to implement, and starvationfree. Roundrobin scheduling can also be applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in computer networks. It is an Operating System concept.
The name of the algorithm comes from the roundrobin principle known from other fields, where each person takes an equal share of something in turn.


For example, if the time slot is 100 milliseconds, and job1 takes a total time of 250 ms to complete, the roundrobin scheduler will suspend the job after 100 ms and give other jobs their time on the CPU. Once
the other jobs have had their equal share (100 ms each), job1 will get another allocation of CPU time and the cycle will repeat. This process continues until the job finishes and needs no more time on the CPU.
Job1 = Total time to complete 250 ms (quantum 100 ms).
1. First allocation = 100 ms.
2. Second allocation = 100 ms.
3. Third allocation = 100 ms but job1 self terminates after 50 ms.
4. Total CPU time of job1 = 250 ms
